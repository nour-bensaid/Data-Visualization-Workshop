# Data-Visualization-Workshop

This repo contains the materials used for a data visualization workshop delivered for GDSC ENSTAB Members.

I've got a cool Jupiter notebook in here that breaks down the nitty-gritty of data visualization in easy-to-understand steps. I've also chucked in the dataset we used during the workshop, so you can practice your data viz skills and experiment with different techniques.

The workshop was all about having fun while learning something new, so we've kept things informal and straightforward in this repo. Feel free to explore and see what you can do with your own data!
